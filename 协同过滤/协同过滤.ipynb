    "# Collaborative filtering\n",
    "协同过滤常用于推荐系统。这些技术目的是填补 user-item 矩阵中缺失项。MLlib 目前支持基于协同过滤模型的交替最小二乘法（ALS）算法来预测缺失的item。在MLlib 中的实现具体要设置以下参数  \n",
    "* numBlocks is the number of blocks used to parallelize computation (set to -1 to auto-configure).\n",
    "* rank is the number of latent factors in the model.\n",
    "* iterations is the number of iterations to run.\n",
    "* lambda specifies the regularization parameter in ALS.\n",
    "* implicitPrefs specifies whether to use the explicit feedback ALS variant or one adapted for implicit feedback data.\n",
    "* alpha is a parameter applicable to the implicit feedback variant of ALS that governs the baseline confidence in preference observations.\n",

    "## 显式与隐式反馈(Explicit vs. implicit feedback)\n",
    "The standard approach to matrix factorization based collaborative filtering treats the entries in the user-item matrix as explicit preferences given by the user to the item.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common in many real-world use cases to only have access to implicit feedback (e.g. views, clicks, purchases, likes, shares etc.). The approach used in MLlib to deal with such data is taken from Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets. Essentially instead of trying to model the matrix of ratings directly, this approach treats the data as a combination of binary preferences and confidence values. The ratings are then related to the level of confidence in observed user preferences, rather than explicit ratings given to items. The model then tries to find latent factors that can be used to predict the expected preference of a user for an item.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scaling of the regularization parameter\n",
    "Since v1.1, we scale the regularization parameter lambda in solving each least squares problem by the number of ratings the user generated in updating user factors, or the number of ratings the product received in updating product factors. This approach is named “ALS-WR” and discussed in the paper “Large-Scale Parallel Collaborative Filtering for the Netflix Prize”. It makes lambda less dependent on the scale of the dataset. So we can apply the best parameter learned from a sampled subset to the full dataset and expect similar performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "In the following example we load rating data. Each row consists of a user, a product and a rating. We use the default ALS.train() method which assumes ratings are explicit. We evaluate the recommendation model by measuring the Mean Squared Error of rating prediction.\n"
